University Recommender System
Hi! I'm building an intelligent University Recommender System that helps students around the world find the most suitable universities based on their academic background, budget, and preferences. This project is especially designed for students who are looking for funded or affordable study opportunities abroad.

🔍 What I Did
I created a full-stack web application using Flask and Python, powered by a custom-made dataset of over 1,000 universities from different countries.

🧠 Features
Smart filtering of universities based on:
GPA
IELTS, SAT, AP scores
Budget
Major (e.g., IT, Engineering, Medicine, etc.)
Preferred climate
Project experience level
A user-friendly web interface to input criteria and display matching universities.
Random sampling from filtered results for diverse suggestions.
Extended dataset with additional university metadata:
Country, city, cost of living
Scholarships and grants
Teaching language
QS rankings (national and global)
Program descriptions

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python for backend logic
Flask as the web framework
Pandas for data processing and filtering
HTML + Jinja2 templates for the frontend
A large CSV dataset containing university data from all over the world

📁 Files Included
app.py — Flask web server
model.py — filtering logic based on user input
universities_extended_final_large_ru.csv — the main dataset
templates/index.html — frontend form and results table
